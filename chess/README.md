The intent of this game is to show that I can take on a project with a lot of different components.

The larger display was inspired by this example: https://andrewjh271.github.io/chess/

This project could be improved with:
- a more sophisticated computer AI 
- a turn output like the one in this example: https://andrewjh271.github.io/chess/
- each move should be recorded to a game history
  - undo move should pull from game history instead of undo any piece's previous move.
  - feature to 'replay game' and go through move by move or let it autoplay the whole game.
- Binary search implemented where appropriate
