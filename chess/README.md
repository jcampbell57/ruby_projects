The intent of this game is to show that I can take on a project with a lot of different components.

The larger display was both inspired by this example: https://andrewjh271.github.io/chess/

This project could be improved:
- with a more sophisticated computer AI 
- a turn output like the one in this example: https://andrewjh271.github.io/chess/
